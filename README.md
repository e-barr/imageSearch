# ImageSearch

This is an image search app designed with **JavaScript**, **React**, **semantic ui**, the **Unsplash API** and some plain **HTML/CSS**.

Type in the search term and an api call is made with axios to the unsplash api. The images are rendered with React, and more can be loaded with the "Load More" button.
